> Can't seem to achieve this simple functionality! All I want is to clear a default search term in an input box when it is clicked. The following works up to a point but clears any other text entered, I would've thought resetting search_form_text should have solved this:



      $("#s")
    .val("Search...")
    .css("color", "#ccc")
    .focus(function(){
        $(this).css("color", "black");
        if ($(this).val() == "Search...") {
            $(this).val("");
        }
    })
    .blur(function(){
        $(this).css("color", "#ccc");
        if ($(this).val() == "") {
            $(this).val("Search...");
        }
    });
